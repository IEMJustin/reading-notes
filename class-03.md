# LISTS

## Ordered lists

Ordered lists will allow the user to list items in a numbered order. <br>
Such as a set of instruction that must be followed or an unwanted result may present itself. <br>
An example to utilize this list is presented below. <br>
<br>

### HTML Code input
> \<ol> <br>
> \<li>ExampleA\</li> <br>
> \<li>ExampleB\</li> <br>
> \<li>ExampleC\</li> <br>
> \</ol>

### HTML Code display
> <ol>
> <li>ExampleA</li>
> <li>ExampleB</li>
> <li>ExampleC</li>
> </ol>
<br>

## Unordered lists

Unlike Ordered lists the Unordered lists will display without a numbered order. <br>
Instead it will display with a bullet point. <br>
An example to utilize this list is presented below. <br>
<br>

### HTML Code input
> \<ul>
> \<li>ExampleA\</li>
> \<li>ExampleB\</li>
> \<li>ExampleC\</li>
> \</ul>

### HTML Code display
> <ul>
> <li>ExampleA</li>
> <li>ExampleB</li>
> <li>ExampleC</li>
> </ul>
<br>

## Definition Lists

Definition lists allow the user to list elements along with their definitions below; emphasizing them. <br>
The user will need to utilize three different elements.
Below would be an example to utilize this list.

## HTML Code Input
> \<dl>
> \<dt>ExampleA\</dt> <br>
> \<dd>Example A's definition goes here\</dd> <br>
> \<dt>ExampleB\</dt> <br>
> \<dd>ExampleB's definition goes here\</dd> <br>
> \<dt>ExampleC\</dt> <br>
> \<dd>Example C's definition goes here\</dd> <br>
> \</dl> <br>

> <dl>
> <dt>ExampleA</dt> <br>
> <dd>Example A's definition goes here</dd> <br>
> <dt>ExampleB</dt> <br>
> <dd>ExampleB's definition goes here</dd> <br>
> <dt>ExampleC</dt> <br>
> <dd>Example C's definition goes here</dd> <br>
> </dl>

# Boxes

CSS allows for customization with the shape of boxes. <br>
This includes hiding the boxes if needed. <br>

<br>

## Dimensions

Box dimensions can be manipulated in many different measurements. <br>
Three well known measurements would be pixels, measurements, and ems. <br>
Percentages are affected by the size of the browser window or if browser is within another browser. <br>
Ems are affected by the size of the text within the box and is becoming utilized by designers due to its flexibility. <br>
<br>

Boxes can also be restricted on purpose through limiting width and limiting height. <br>
The height and width's size is controlled through a min/max text. <br>
If the box isn't big enough to display all the text within a box they can overflow. <br>
This would be defined as overflowing content. <br>
Overflowing content would have 2 different properties it can be used which is hidden and scroll. <br>

<br>

## Border, Margin, & Padding

Every box has three available properties for customization. <br>
These three properties are border, margin, and padding. <br>
The border separates the edge of the box from another. <br>
Margins sit outside the edge of the border and creates a gap between the border of two adjacent boxes. <br>
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. <br>

<br>

Border's style and color can also be manipulated.
Border's color can be specified to the user's desired color choice through RGB values, hex codes, or CSS color names. <br>
Border styles are limited to 8 different styles \(nine if you count the hidden one ^_^) which are listed below.
- solid
- dotted
- dashed
- double
- groove
- ridge
- inset
- outset
- hidden or none
