# Chart.js and Canvas

## Chart.js
Charts are considered better for displaying data visually. <br>
Although they may be more visually appealing; charts can be difficult to create. <br>
Charts available are not limited to just bar charts <br>
Options for charts to display could be pie charts and line charts. <br>

## Canvas

Canvas is utilized with the Chart.js <br>
It may look similar to the \<img> element but it does not contain a src or alt attribute. <br>
Canvas may also provide "Fallback Content" for older browsers that do not support it. <br>
A drawback for canvas would be that it does require a closing tag. <br>
Canvas also allows the ability to draw upon it, some functions that can allow this would be listed below.
- beginPath\()
- closePath\()
- stroke\()
 <br>
