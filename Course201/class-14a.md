# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Transforms

The transform property allows CSS3 to position and alter elements. <br>
The transform property comes in two different settings, 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional. <br>
Each setting also comes with its own properties and values. <br>

It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once. <br>
But using multiple dec;aratopms will not work because each declaration will rewrite the one above it. <br>

## Transitions

Transition provides a change from one state to another. <br>
Animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes. <br>
For the best support across all browsers it would be best to use vendor prefixes. <br>
Transition property determines what properties will be altered. <br>
If multiple properties need to be transitioned they can be separated within the transition-property value with a comma. <br>

Transition Duration determines the duration in which a transition is set to take place. <br>
The programmer is able to set multiple durations for multiple properties but each property can only have one duration set to it. <br>
A programmer also has the ability to delay a transitionl this would be referred to as transition delay. <br>

# Animations

Animations are good for building visual interactions from one state to another. <br>
But if the programmer requires more control then the transitions need to have multiple states. <br>
Animations will be have really similar to transitions. <br>
