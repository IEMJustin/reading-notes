## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
CSS treats each HTML element as if it was in its own box. <br>
The box could be either inline or a block level box. <br>
Position of elements can be controlled with CSS different positioning schemes. <br>
These schemes would be Normal Flow, Relative Positioning, Absolute Positioning, Fixed Positioning, and Floating Elements. <br>

Normal flows is static, and each block level element would sit on top of the next. <br>
Relative positioning is relative and moves an element in rleation to where it would have been in normal flow. <br>
Absolute positioning is absolute which means it no longers affects the position of other elements on the page. <br>
Fixed positioning is fixed and requires the position property to have a value of fixed. <br>

Overlapping elements can happen when using relative, fixed or absolute positioning. <br>
Floating elements will allow an element to be taken and placed as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible. <br>
Clearing floats allow the property to say that no element within the same containing element should touch the left or right hand sides of a box. <br>
Another useful thing floats could be used for is multi-column layouts. <br>

Screen sizes and Resolution will have a big effect on how the webpage is displayed. <br>

Fixed width layouts don't change sizes when the user increases or decreases their browser window. <br>
Liquid Layouts will expand or minimize to the size of the user's browser. <br>
Layout Grids show how the page was designed. <br>
