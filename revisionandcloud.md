### Version Control
There are 3 different Version Controls for Git. Depending on the current project being worked on, one will decide to utilize one over the other.
Local Version Control would be the control that allows for a programmer to store a database on their own hard disk and change them as they see fit.
Centralized Version Control would be one of the options for collaborating with another programmer by storing all changes and files to a single server. 
Multiple clients would be able to access this server but if the server malfunctioned it would be unaccessable to all users.
A Distributed Version Control would provide all the benefits of a CVC but it allowed for users to create a mirrored repository on their local machine.

### GIT
Git is a DVCS that allows provides the user with the ability to save "snapshots" of your project when you run a commit command. 
It does rely on local resources due to the location of necessary information.
It benefits users by cutting out the need to access history information from the server itself, allowing a user to work even offline.
Although GIT can't prevent all incidents of losing data, it can minimize the damage and loss of files.
