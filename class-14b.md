# What Google Learned About Teams

Gathering information from the story it seemed at first as if the team Rozovsky was being assigned to would be the perfect combination due to the amount of brilliant minds. <br>
That plan backfired hard due to the inability of her team to cooperate. <br>
Having knowledge may seem like the golden ticket but not having the "people skills" will drive a person off the path to success real quick. <br>
A quick and simple fix would be for each individual to work on their ability to create "small talk". <br>

Small talk would "break the ice" and open the floor for a "more approachable" type of impression. <br>
Instead it seems the "brilliant minds" kept trying to establish dominance for no reason. <br>
I believe that if a person wants to be successful within a team then they must be able to communicate respectively. <br>
Attempting to communicate without respect for another individual will only have negative outcomes. <br>
