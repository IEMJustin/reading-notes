# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### Functions, Methods, and Objects
Functions, Methods, and Objects allow for a programmer to organize trheir code. <br>
Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together to perform a specific task. <br>
Methods are similar to functions but they are created inside an object. <br>
Objects are made up of properties and methods. <br>

### Links
Links allow for a fluid web-surfing experience by allowing the user a direct path to another url through a single click. <br>
Links have multiple ways of being used whether they direct the user to a new window or sends the user to the url within the same tab. <br>
Links are created using the \<a>urlgoeshere\</a> element.
Anything within that element is clickable. <br>

### Link Examples

> Link to other site
> \<ul> <br>
> \<li>\<a href="https://www.codefellows.org/"> <br>
>    CodeFellows\</a>\</li> <br>
> </ul> <br>

Link to other pages on the same site
> \<ul> <br>
> \<li>\<a href="index.html">Home\</a>\</li> <br>
> \</ul> <br>

### Directory Structure

When operating on a larger website it is good practice to organize code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. <br>
These folders are also known as directories. <br>
The main homepage of a site written in HTML is called index.html. <br>
The relationship between files and folders are similar to that of a "family tree". <br>
