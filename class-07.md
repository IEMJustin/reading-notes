# Object Oriented Programming

### The Dom

The DOM would be the topmost object. <br>
It repesents the webpage loaded in the current window. <br>

Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties and methods of the string object on that value <br>
Whenever accessing an array, each character within the string is given an index number. <br>
These index numbers will start at 0. <br>

There are six data types withing JavaScript:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Undefined
- Null
- Object

Some commonly used terms:
- Integer: A whole number (not a fraction).
- Real Number: A number that can contain a fraction part.
- Floating Point Number: A real number that uses decimals to represent a fraction.
- Scientific Notation: A way of writing numbers that are too big or too small to be convieniently written in decimal form.

The Math Object has properties and methods for mathematical constants and function.
Examples listed below:
- Math.PI: Returns pi
- Math.round(): Rounds number to the nearest integer
- Math.sqrt(n): Returns square root of positive number
- Math.ceil(): Rounds number up to the nearest integer
- Math.floor(): Rounds number down to the nearest integer
- Math.random(): Generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (not inclusive)

Creating a "Date Object" will allow a programmer to set and retrieve the time and date it represents.
A few methods of this are listed below:
- getDate(): Returns the day of the month \(1-31)
- getDay(): Returns the day of the week \(0-6)
- setDate(): Sets the day of the month \(1-31)

### Tables

A table represents information in a grid format. <br>
Each block in the grid would be referred to as a "table cell" <br>
Grids allow a viewer to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.

The core of a table is made of the following
- The Table Element \<table>
- The Table Row \<tr> 
- The Table Data \<td>

Not all all browsers will create the lines that surround the table, so the programmer might have to input those extras via CSS. <br>
The table itself can be manipulated to stretch across vertically and horizontally. <br>
This feature would be referred to as spanning. <br>
There are 3 elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows. <br>
These 3 elements also help people who use screen readers; these elements are listed below:
- \<thead>
- \<tbody>
- \<tfoot>
