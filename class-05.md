# Images, Color, and Text

## Images

Images can make a webpage feel welcoming and less bland. <br>
For larger websites it is preferred to keep images in a separate folder. <br>
The height and width can be adjusted on a picture although it may become distorted if not a vector image. <br>
Deciding where to place an image may also have an effect with the content in its nearby surroundings. <br>

There is typically 3 rules when creating images which are
- Save images in the right format
- Save images in the right size
- Measure images in pixels

There are several tools that provide a user with the ability to edit an image. <br>
One of the most popular tools would be Adobe Photoshop. <br>
It is preferred to save images with "flat" color as a GIF or PNG file. <br>

### Image Dimension

Images on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear. <br>


When saving images it is best practice to save your images at 300 pixel per inch. <br>
Animated GIFS display several frames of an image in sequence replicating a video. <br>
Although this option may sound fun, it can be detrimental to the webpage due to the longer loading time for a visitor to the webpage.  <br>
Images also have the ability to be transparent. <br>

## Color

Deciding on the right color combination for a webpage can make a really big impression to users who visit the website. <br>
Colors for the webpage can be selected by RGB, HEX CODES, or COLOR NAMES. <br>
The qualities of these colors can be further customized through RGB and HEX CODES. <br>
When deciding color combinations the programmer must also take into factor the contrast of text, foreground, and background colors. <br>

### CSS3

Allows for a programmer to specify colors as HSL values and an optional opacity value. <br>
Although this may be the most customizable in terms of color choice, not all browsers support it.
This in turn may have a programmer have to fall back on another supported format for a different browser. <br>

## Text

The properties that allow a programmer to directly affect text would be <br>
- Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
- Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what you is used
Some examples of typeface available would be SERIF, SANS-SERIF, MONOSPACE, CURSIVE, FANTASY. <br>
Although there is a multitude of fonts some may be used only if paid for due to copyright. <br>
