### Describing Structures of a Webpage

HTML code is made up characters that are within angled brackets, they are also referred to as HTML elements.
Elements consist of an opening and a closing tag.
HTML uses Elements to describe the structure of a page.
This allows the user to organize content in a more readable fashion.

### Markup Extras

There are 3 types of HTML versions and they are HTML 4, XHTML 1.0, and HTML5.
HTML 4 is no longer recommended due to CSS being able to perform the same functions with changing page appearance.
XHTML is the results of HTML being made to follow rules of XML.
XHTML was very compatible with other programs that are written to create and process XML documents.
HTML5 is a work in progress although it has been implemented by major browser makers.

Escape Characters will allow a character that is normally used for HTML code to be visible.
The Meta Element is not visible to users but assists the search engines with locating information about your page.
Iframes allow the user to display another page within the page such as displaying a gps location of restaurants on a page about  Italian Food.
Block Elements will appear on a new line while Inline Elements will appear to continue on the same line.
DOCTYPES will allow your browser to know which version of HTML you are inputting.
