# Programming with JavaScript

Javascript has the following operators
- Assignment Operators
- Comparison Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
- String Operators
- Conditional (ternary) Operator
- Comma Operator
- Unary Operators
- Relational Operators

JavaScript has both binary and unary operators. 
They also have one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.
A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.
A unary operator requires a single operand before or after the operator.

### Assignment Operators

An assignment operator will assign a value to the left operand based on the value of its right operand.
There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand.
A shorthand assignment operators is a shorter way of expressing something that is previously available in the JavaScript programming language.

> Ex: x = y

> The value of x would be assigned to the value y 

> Ex: x += y

> The value of x would in turn be the same value of x + y


### Return Values and Chaining

Assignments have return values which can be retrieved.

### Example
> function sum(1+2) {

>   var result = 1 + 2;

>   return result;

> }

Shown above the return value matches the expression to the right of the = sign.
Return value are based on the operands prior to the operation.
In case of logical assignment, (x &&=y),(x ||= y), and (x ??=y).
The return value is that of the logical operation with out the assignment.

### Expressions

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
There are two types of expressions that perform differently.
One expression would assign a value and the other typically evaluates to resolve a value.

### Expression Categories

- Arithmetic
- String
- Logical
- Primary Expressions
- Left-hand-side expressions

### Some common expressions utilized
- this
- function
- new
- super

## Defining functions

A function definition consists of the word function, followed by the name of the function
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript's statement that define the function, enclosed within curly brackets.
