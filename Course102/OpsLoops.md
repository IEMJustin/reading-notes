## Operators and Loops

### Operators

There are multiple operators that can be utilized depending on the required task at hand.
An assignment operator will assign a value to the left operand based on the value of its right operand. There are also compound assignment operators that are shorthand. A shorthand assignment operators is a shorter way of expressing something that is previously available in the JavaScript programming language.

### Loops and iteration

Loops will offer a simple way to do something repetitively.
They can be endless until given the command to stop their endless cycle.
The types of loops are plentiful and can function differently during their cycles.

### Variations of Loops

- for statement
- do...while statement
- while statement
- labeled statement
- break statement
- continue statement
- for...in statement
- for...of statement

#### for statement

- A for loop repeats until a certain condition evaluates false.

#### do...while statement

 - The do...while statment repeats until a certain condition comes false.

 #### while statement
 - A while statement will continue to loop as long as a certain condition stays true.

#### labeled statement
- A label statement will allow you to refer to it elsewhere within your program.

#### break statement
- Break statements allow you to end a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.
- While using a break without a label, it will terminate the innermost enclosing while, do-while, for, or switch immediately and transfer control to the next statement.
- When using break with a label it will terminate the specific labeled statement.

#### continue statement
- The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.

#### for...in statement
- The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object.
> It would look similar to the example below

> for (variable in object)

    statement

#### for...of statement
- The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over multiple iterable objects
