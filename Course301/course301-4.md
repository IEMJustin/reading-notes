# React and Forms

1. A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.
2. React will only store when setState() is used and is driven by the input's value so it sounds like it would be a better idea to have an up to date state.
3. We can use event.target.name

1. It can fit on one line of code and seems to function the same as react with "shortcuts" to completing long lines of codes.
2. x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
