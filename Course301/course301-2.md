# State and Props

### React LifeCycle
1. Render happens before componentDidMount.
2. Constructor will happen first in the lifecycle.
3. Constructor, render, React Updates componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount.
4. componentDidMount will allow a software developer to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM.

### What can you pass in props
You can pass what you want to initliaze your component or what you want your component to render.

### Difference between State and Props
A State is inside the component while props are handled outside of the component.

### When do we re-render our application
When the state is changed our application will re-render.

### What can we store in state
Any information within a component that needs to be updated such as a list that a user would be inputting data into.
