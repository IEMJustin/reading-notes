Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is highly useful in customizing ones own webpage via placement and color control.
The language itself is broken up into modules.
CSS is a rule-based language meaning the rules set for specific groups are applied to that specific element or groups of elements on your webpage.
Each rule begins with a selector, this will select which HTML element is going to be styled.

 Limitations

Although CSS is useful with customizing a webpage they do have limitations dependent on the browser of users.
Most browsers have full compatibilty  with CSS except Internet Explorer.
Few browsers have compatibility issues based on bugs from previous version but most up to date browsers have been able to allow for compatibility.
